# SaleCycleTest

Hello Scott!

fetchBasketDatas.js is the javascript only file. It contains the js code needed to validate the exercice.
fetchBasketDatasTesting.html is for testing. As long as you respect the format,	you can add as many articles you want, it will always work the same.
Just open it in your browser to see the result.

This exercice take me an hour and ten minutes to complete. Every feedback is welcome.
I tried to make it as readable as possible, and the code is pretty simple. That being said, if you have questions I will be more than happy to answer them.
